<p>I remember making my first item of clothing over 20 years ago with my Mum for a friend’s wedding and was hooked straight away! I found the process of taking a folded up piece of fabric and then cutting and sewing it into something completely new totally magical and this feeling still remains.
</p> <br/><p>Whilst I was at school my love of sewing led me to costuming several school productions and creating a catwalk collection for a charity fashion show.  When I headed to university the costuming of student productions continued (including costuming Little Shop of Horrors in the Oxford Playhouse).  I also created many black-tie and ball dresses during this time.
</p> <br/><p>Having spent a childhood in “The Good Life” (self-sufficiency on a smallholding), values of sustainability are hugely important to me.  Combining this with a love of fashion and creativity it seemed only natural to take clothes and textiles that were no longer wanted and turn them into something fresh and new.  
</p> <br/><p>Each item I have made has its history, whether it was a suit jacket or a bridesmaid’s dress and its story continues through the new item. Where the original garment has come from a charity shop then the new creation has also supported a very worthwhile cause
</p> <br/><p>I always love the challenge of a commission so please get in touch if you would like me to consider anything in particular.
</p> <p>All items are designed and handmade by me in Oxfordshire
